# guaranteed to fit on to any nominal 8GB SD card using the 'dd' command.

# Production SD cards are partitioned over the first 7100MiB (1024*1024) of the SD card. This is deliberatrly not the full
# capacity of an 8GB SD card but it should be the 'lowest common demonitor' of a size that all 8GB SD card can hold.

# Do a number of sanity checks first.
# 1) Check that there are two command line parameters. 1) sd card's device and 2) file  name to save dd image as 
# 2) A check the card's byte capacity
# 3) Check that there are 6 partitions on the SD card.
